# BrainTumours
This project involves developing a system that can detect brain tumors using image processing and machine learning techniques. The primary objective of the project is to implement a system that takes MRI images, processes them, and then uses machine learning to find any tumors, whether they are malignant or benign. The dataset used in the project consists of 500 images, where 250 images are labeled as 'yes' for brain tumors, and 250 are labeled as 'no' for brain tumors. The algorithm developed for the system detects these tumors using a wide range of images and predicts how the tumor will develop by generating new images of the tumor. Image processing techniques, such as noise reduction in the images and segmenting the tumor from the rest of the brain, are used to improve the accuracy of the method.

The motivation behind this project is to develop a system that can eliminate human error and reduce the time needed for doctors to detect brain tumors, which can be a lengthy process. The existing treatments for brain tumors, such as radiation, CT scans, or X-rays, can have drawbacks such as radiation exposure. A system that does not require such treatments can have significant advantages.

The system was developed using Python programming language, and supervised learning techniques were used to label the data. The system takes in MRI images, preprocesses them, and applies machine learning algorithms to detect the presence of brain tumors. The system's accuracy was evaluated using various metrics, and it was found to be effective in detecting brain tumors.

Overall, the project aims to develop a system that can accurately detect brain tumors using image processing and machine learning techniques, thereby reducing the time needed for diagnosis and minimizing the potential risks associated with existing treatments.
